      Spot-A-Tron is a Twitter clone designed solely for posting "Spotify":http://www.spotify.com URLs and sharing them with your friends, so it's easy to tell your friends what you're listening to.

    Planned features for Spot-A-Tron include specific user feeds, the ability to follow people (like Twitter),
    Twitter integration, and whatever else I can be bothered to do.

      Spot-A-Tron was made by #{link_to 'Mac', 'http://www.shrieking.net'} over Christmas 2008 in a buck's fizz
      fueled frenzy, and is the first thing to appear on
      #{link_to 'Very Happy Things', 'http://www.veryhappythings.co.uk'}.  It is written in
      #{link_to 'Ruby on Rails', 'http://www.rubyonrails.org'} and is forever indebted to the awesomeness of
      #{link_to 'HAML', 'http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/'}, #{link_to 'Kuler', 'http://kuler.adobe.com'} and
      #{link_to 'Nigella','http://www.nigella.com/'}.
